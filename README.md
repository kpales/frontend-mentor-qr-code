## My process

### Built with

- Next.js framework
- Custom CSS layout
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I tried to play around with Next.js framework. First time using it and I tried to wokr through this project using guidance from next.js official documentation.

I learned a lot about React, Next and how it differs from Vue and Nuxt frameworks.

### Continued development

I want to focus more and more on React frameworks. Might try next time with Remix to compare it. The biggest concept that I found it differently and most challenging was the different approach that React has vs Vue.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/) - The official Next js documentation helped me with the project
